AI-Powered Sales Forecasting System
This repository contains the code and resources for building an AI-Powered Sales Forecasting System using machine learning techniques, particularly Prophet, to predict sales for local stores. The system helps businesses forecast their sales, improve inventory management, and avoid overstocking or understocking products.

Features
Sales Forecasting: Predicts future sales for individual products (e.g., clothing, groceries).
Historical Data Analysis: Analyzes past sales data and identifies trends such as seasonality and promotions.
Customizable: The system can be easily tailored to different stores based on their specific sales data.
Subscription Model: Potentially deployable as a SaaS offering for local businesses to access forecasts on a subscription basis.
Tools & Technologies
Python: Main programming language for building the machine learning model and backend.
Prophet: Time-series forecasting model for predicting future sales.
Flask: Web framework for deploying the forecasting model as an API.
Streamlit: Frontend framework for creating an interactive user interface.
pandas & numpy: Libraries for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib: Library for visualizing forecasts.
